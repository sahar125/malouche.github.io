I'm Dhafer Malouche, I'm a Professor of Statistics at the [University of Carthage](http://www.ucar.rnu.tn/En/). I'm teaching at the [*Ecole Supérieure de la Statistique et de l'Analyse de l'Information*](http://www.essai.rnu.tn/accueil.htm)  several data science courses: Big Data, Computing tools for Statistics such as `R` and Python, Bayesian Statistics and Time Series.

I like using a lot `R`  and  Python for  Data Analysis and Exploring patterns. `H2O` and `Spark` are  my preferred softwares dor machine and deep learning to perform big  data analysis. 

You will find in this website several tutorials about  `R`, Python, Big Data, Machine Learning... You can also find the links to  my papers and learn more about my  research interests. Links and tutorials on my   `R` packages are also available here.
