I'm Dhafer Malouche, I'm a Professor of Statistics at the [University of Carthage](http://www.ucar.rnu.tn/En/). I'm teaching at the [*Ecole Supérieure de la Statistique et de l'Analyse de l'Information*](http://www.essai.rnu.tn/accueil.htm)  several data science courses: Big Data, Computing tools for Statistics such as `R` and Python, Bayesian Statistics and Time Series.

I like using `R` a lot and  Python for Data Analysis and Exploring patterns. `H2O` and `Spark` are  my preferred machine and deep learning softwares for data analysis. 

You will find in this website several tutorials on these topics. You can also discover my papers and my  research interests. You can also download   my  `R` packages.   

If you have any comments, questions or suggestions feel free to [contact me](mailto:dhafer.malouche@yale.edu)
